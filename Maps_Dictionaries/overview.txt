Hash Table is a data structure which organizes data using hash functions in order to support quick insertion and search.

There are two different kinds of hash tables: hash set and hash map.

-> The hash set is one of the implementations of a set data structure to store no repeated values.

-> The hash map is one of the implementations of a map data structure to store (key, value) pairs.

It is easy to use a hash table with the help of standard template libraries. Most common languages such as Java, C++ and Python support both hash set and hash map.

By choosing a proper hash function, the hash table can achieve wonderful performance in both insertion and search.
